## How To Play

The game starts automatically as soon as browser window is loaded (indicated by the running timer).

Player's objective is to correctly guess all the card pairs by flipping only two of them at the time.

At the beginning of the game, player's score is set to maximum (indicated by stars in the score panel) and decreases as player progresses with moves.

Once all the cards are successfully matched (they remain flipped), player wins the game and receives pop-up window which includes statistics for given round and button for resetting the game.

Player can enjoy this game across all the widely used devices.
